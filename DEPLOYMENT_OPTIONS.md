## Method 1: Direct Deployment with Token ⭐

**Best for: Quick one-time deployment**

### What You Need:
- [x] New owner creates GitHub token
- [x] New owner creates empty repository
- [x] New owner shares token with you

### Steps:

**Owner does (3 minutes):**
```bash
1. Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: profit-analysis
   - Create repository

2. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate new token (classic)
   - Select: repo ✓
   - Copy token (ghp_xxx...)

3. Share with you:
   - GitHub username
   - Token
```

**You do (2 minutes):**
```bash
cd profit-analysis
bash deploy-with-token.sh

# Enter when prompted:
# - Their GitHub username
# - Repository name (profit-analysis)
# - Their token (ghp_xxx...)

# Done! Repository deployed.
```

**Security:**
- ✅ Token expires (they set duration)
- ✅ Token can be revoked immediately after
- ✅ Token cleared from memory automatically

**Result:** Repository is live at `https://github.com/username/profit-analysis`
